# UPDATE 04/03/23

I may be putting this down, even though I just started due to my inital idea never came as I wanted to. I realized most my code bases are used by profile service and for a smooth transition I would need to copy naming. Which I don't want. Also, the main purpose of this didn't go as plan, as memory store relies that datastore is up. If this is to be picked up again I will have an external method EVERYONE can setup. (Whether it is asking for API link or my own service)

# DataKeep
 The final data saving solution you need

# Naming Dictionary
Store - A store is a class that holds inner savable objects, Keep(s), from a datastore (DataStoreService:GetDataStore())
Keep - Inner data holding class that gets saved in the saving cycle. Holds data, variables and methods for functionality.

# DataKeep VS ProfileService
